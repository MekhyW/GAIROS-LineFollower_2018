## What is a Speed Line Follower?

In this competition, teams must build and program an autonomous robot to follow a closed-loop circuit consisting of a white line printed on a black plane, in the shortest time possible, and stop on the starting point by itself. After three days of competition, the final ranks are determined by the shortest recorded time of each robot, across all rounds.
